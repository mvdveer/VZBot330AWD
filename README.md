# VZBot330AWD   VZ.254
Configuration backup for VZBot330AWD
This printer started as a Tronxy X5SA back in the day. The initial conversion was to a VZBot 330.

The most recent update was to a AWD version of this printer. It is an all printed version - No CNC parts as in the kits from Mellow Fly

It is powered by a BTT Octopus pro board, raspi pi4B 4gb and a Mellow Fly SHT36 v2 Canbus board connected to a Fly UTOC3 bridge

The original plan was to use the 5160pro TMC steppers but I could not get these to work with the BTT Octopus Pro board.
